I got sunburnt yesterday. 

I put on sunscreen before leaving the house. I put sunscreen on my face, legs, and back, but apparently my forearms did not deserve protection and I am paying the consequences now. It makes me feel stupid because this is something that was so easily avoidable.

This annoys me on so many levels, so I am hoping I can prevent other people from having the same experience.

Every summer, british tourists would flock to spanish beaches, and end up awfully sunburnt, underestimating the consequences of being outside in the sun without sunscreen. It was a funny and recurrent joke, and it was very easy to identify british and german tourists only because of their shrimp-like skin colour. After almost three years in the UK, I have apparently forgotten about what the sun can do to you, and I am now one of those sunburnt british people who act like they have never seen the sun in their lives. It is embarassing.


I was told years ago that sunscreen is more effective than any antiaging cream, since UV light from the sun causes photoaging. I never really fact-checked that information until now, I just assumed it to be true. While doing some research, I found [this study from 2013](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.7326/0003-4819-158-11-201306040-00002) that shows some evidence of the effects of sunscreen. If you're currently using an antiaging cream, throw it in the bin and start putting on sunscreen whenever you're outside. Even in winter.

In some parts of Spain, you should avoid being out in the sun during peak hours, and remember to stay hydrated. No amount of sunscreen can protect you from andalusian 40-degrees-in-the-shade weather. 

There is a famous essay commonly known as [Wear Sunscreen](https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column-column.html), although that is not its original title.
My teenage self loved it because of its positive take on life. My present self shamefully still loves it, but it is now being read through a more cynical lens. I would be happy to debate anyone who either praises it or criticises it, so I encourage you to do it.

In the event that you do get a sunburn, remember to drink lots of water and put on hydrating cream or aloe vera.

I hope you enjoy my writing, but if you don’t, that’s okay.
