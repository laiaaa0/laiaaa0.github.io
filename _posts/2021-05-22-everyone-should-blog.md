I recently saw a post on LinkedIn, where someone announced their participation in a coursera course that I had done a year ago. The way it was written, and the reaction it had from LinkedIn, made me think that by doing that on-line course, that person was progressing their career, or at least doing something useful with their life. In the time where I was doing the course, it seemed like a distraction and a waste of time. I wonder whether, if I had posted it on-line, I would have felt that what I was doing was important, or relevant, or was progressing my career, instead of just believing that I was doing it for fun. 

So I started thinking, what other things do I do, that I feel are irrelevant, would get a massive reaction on-line? My pre-conception was that people who wrote blogs had their lives figured out, until I started meeting people who did. I guess we're all in our different journey, and by putting messages out there, I am not claiming to hold the truth, but sharing my approach to it. By having a blog, I am not trying to transmit that I am better than other people, I just do it to feel validated by an on-line community that congratulates anyone for starting a coursera course.

There is a slight mismatch between the person I would like to be, and the person I currently am, specifically in the side projects that I start but never finish. As a software engineer and roboticist, I am expected to stay up late on weekends coding frantically until I have a nice portfolio of prototypes that will push my career forward. Although I would love to be that person, there are two barriers that are not allowing me to become it: First, I like to sleep on weekends, and second,  I struggle to finish projects. Having a blog where I can post updates of the projects I want to do, the ones I have started and ranting about why I am not finishing them is a way to hold myself accountable for them. This will not change my love of sleep, but it might boost my motivation by reminding myself of what I want to achieve, and show the progress I make, hopefully boosting my motivation. Setting up a blog with github pages is one of the first projects that I finished, and I hope it sets a precedent for the next ones to come. For anyone interested, [this is the tutorial](gh-tutorial) that I followed, and I probably will want to change more things until I am comfortable to share it with the rest of the world.

I named my post "Why should everyone have a blog", then rambled on about the reasons why *I* should have one. I understand that everyone is living something different, and that what I think is relevant might not be relevant to other people. However, most of the people I know fascinate me, because of their complexities, their thoughts, their passions. I feel the world would be a better place if we all shared a little bit more of ourselves, being more transparent, and displaying a range of interest that defies the world's desire to trap us in tiny labelled boxes. 

I hope you enjoy my writing, but if you don't, that's okay.
