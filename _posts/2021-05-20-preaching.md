Preaching and why I don't do it

In the past weeks, Texas has passed a new bill that bans abortion at six weeks of gestation. Part of me feels enraged, since I think legislating women's bodies should be part of our past, not our present. I could dive deep into what my personal opinions are on the subject, quoting a bunch of articles and facts about what constitutes life, what the effects of abortion laws have on lower income areas, or what impact this might have on young women in a state where sex education is practically non-existant. 
However, I do not think preaching my opinion is the way to solve an issue such as this. Althought it would be great, I cannot assume that I have the capability to convince people who do not think like me, and I believe the energy I would invest into attempting to change someone's mind can be used elsewhere. People are generally not willing to change their opinions, and here I share a few reasons of why I think that is.

**Tribes**

Humans are social animals. Acceptance in a group, and having a strong support network are beneficial, and we continuously look for groups of likeminded people who will validate us. This has the risk of falling in an echo-chamber, where the only opinions and beliefs we hear are the ones that agree with our own.  It also means that if we ever change our mind, we will be in contradiction with the people arround us, and losing that support network is terrifying. Whenever someone changes their mind, they usually change the people around them, either consciously or unconsciously.

**Admitting you're wrong**

I recently was thinking about the amount of people that I know that have no problem admitting they are wrong, and it is probably a handful. I also find it really hard sometimes, and I am trying to be more comfortable with it. Ego plays a big part in preventing me from admitting my flaws, and I don't want my past self to be wrong, because that would mean that the decisions I took in the past aren't valid anymore. However, I am trying to distance my present self from my past self, and find that changing my mind is an opportunity to grow. 
There is also a certain social stigma to admitting you're wrong, often viewed as a sign of weakness. In movies and tv shows, the main character doesn't often admit they are wrong or that they make a mistake, it is usually them proving to the rest of the world that they were right. I am trying to find a movie where someone changes their beliefs, or their principles in the middle of the story, and that doesn't make them weaker, it just shows that they are mature enough to allow themselves to change.

**My grandma**

My grandma is 89 years old. She is catholic, and always tells me that women should not be in positions of power. She also decided to vote for a rightwing party in the last election just to spite the rest of the family. I know I will not change her opinion on this, because she does not want to change it. She likes having her own special belief system, and she likes being different from the rest. I also found that our relationship is strained when the little time I spend with her is spent debating about religion, feminism and politics. At this point, I have accepted my grandma the way she is, and decided not to bring up controversial subjects. I prefer that my conversations come from a place of love, not from the satisfaction gained from making someone change their mind, so I'd rather ask her about her day, and her garden, rather than try to prove that I'm right.


 I hope you enjoy my writing, but if you don't, that's okay.
