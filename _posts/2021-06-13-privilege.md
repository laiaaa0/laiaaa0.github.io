This morning I had a conversation where I said that men have the privilege of not being catcalled when they walk down the street. This started a debate on what it means to have a privilege, and if we should use that word or not.

I believe that I am privileged because of my race, my parents and because of the opportunities I had growing up. This is accompanied of a certain amount of guilt, as well as gratefulness. I simultaneously think that I am very lucky to have all the things I have in life, and question whether I would have achieved those same things without my privilege.

I have accepted my privilege, and I learnt that I don’t have to feel bad about it. It is not my fault. However, this means that I usually throw around the word “privilege” without taking into consideration how other people might feel. If someone’s description of privilege is something negative, they will feel attacked if I ask them to check their privilege. I have no problem removing the word privilege from my discourse when trying to explain the things that I am affected by, if that will help me transmit my ideas. But I still believe that it is a privilege not to be catcalled, because it is a right that only a particular group has.

For some reason, people find it difficult to accept their privilege. They might think that having privilege means that they hadn’t had to fight for anything in life. They might associate privilege with having everything. A white gay man might struggle to recognize their privilege as a white man because they can only perceive the oppression they experienced due to their sexual orientation.
A point that I struggled to transmit was that even if you haven’t had any experience that shows that you had privilege, the lack of negative experiences (like being catcalled) is still a privilege. It is difficult to be aware of the experiences that you don’t have, which is why it is so hard to see. Privilege is a concept that exists in many different axis. I am privileged in many of them, but my gender is not a privilege in most situations, which is why feminism exists.

When I talk about privilege, I talk about taking things for granted. The discussion this morning ended up with the sentence “if we say that what is normal is a privilege, we are lowering the bar of what is normal”. The answer to that has come to me some hours later: We are fighting for rights, for what is normal. And having a right that other people do not have is a privilege.
